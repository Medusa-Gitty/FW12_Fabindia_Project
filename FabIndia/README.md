Here, I am going to share about the whole experience of my very first construct week in which we cloned one of the web stores - FABINDIA. 

## Project Team: 
1) Dinesh Kumar
2) Sayak Mohanta
3) Priya Darshini S
4) Gautam H

## Project Description
As a team of 4 with above mentioned members we have completed the front-end clone of Fabindia.
Fabindia is India’s one of the largest private web-stores,  which sells garments, furnishings and ethnic products that are made from traditional techniques, skills and hand-based processes by craftspeople across rural India.

We decide to clone few of the most important features of a e-commerce website i.e., Sign-up/Sign-in page, Home page, Products display page, cart page, checkout and  payment process page.
Each of us worked on specific features and collaboratively solved all the challenges that we came across. Everyone of us have been supportive to each other in all the situations and completed this project successfully.

We made use of an open source management tool which allows multiple developers to work together in a project - “GIT”.  We stored all the development files in github.com website as individual repository and committed it to the main repository only after cross verifying every individual team members work, which made it simpler to keep a track in changes.
